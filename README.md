# reCursor

This script helps you extend your free trial on the Cursor editor by updating your device IDs. It automatically backs up your settings and creates new device identifiers.

If you ever encounter an error like this:

"Too many free trial accounts used on this machine. Please upgrade to pro. We have this limit in place to prevent abuse. Please let us know if you believe this is a mistake."
